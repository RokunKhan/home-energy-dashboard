## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project is currently in the **planning and simulation** phase.

- Simulated data is being logged to ThingSpeak successfully using Python and ESP32 test code.
- A web dashboard has been created to display live current and power readings.
- Auto-color logic and live charts are implemented for visual feedback.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
- Connect and test the actual CT sensor (SCT-013-000) with the ESP32
- Build a working prototype on a breadboard
- Design and fabricate a custom PCB for a cleaner hardware setup
- Integrate real sensor data into the existing dashboard

ðŸ“Œ This repository currently reflects the **functional planning and simulation** â€” full hardware integration is in progress.
